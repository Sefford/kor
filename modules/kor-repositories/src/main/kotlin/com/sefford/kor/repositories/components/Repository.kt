/**
 * Interface for Repositories.
 *
 *
 * They work on a simple CRUD API.
 *
 *
 * Aditionally each repository can flag in advance if the repository itself is "ready" through
 * [isReady interface][Repository.isReady].
 *
 * Might be cases, as Network Repositories or Disk Repositories where the availability might not be guaranteed
 * because of hardware or connectivity problems.
 *
 *
 * Checking in advance for the availability of the repository might save the developer unnecessary errors
 * because the repository is in an incorrect state.
 *
 *
 * The availability of a repo may vary over time and everytime an operation is performed over the repository
 * the availability will be checked.
