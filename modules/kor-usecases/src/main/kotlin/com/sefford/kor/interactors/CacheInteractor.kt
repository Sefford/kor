 * CacheInteractor is the default implementation of a strategy for Cache-related Interactors.

 * This strategy retrieves the delegate's information from the Repository then notifies if the information
 * was successfully retrieved from it.

 * To do not disturb the process of fetching from network, as the lru delegate work faster this
 * implementation of CacheInteractor does not notifies of errors to the UI.
 *
 *
 * It delegates the work to a [CacheDelegate][com.sefford.kor.interactors.interfaces.CacheDelegate] object.
