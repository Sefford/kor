 * Abstract Interactor

 *
 * It delegates its work to a "Delegate" object. In this level, only a InteractorNotificacion implementation exists
 * for logging purposes, but more specialized versions of this class will require the delegate object
 * to implement further interfaces to properly follow each of the strategies.
