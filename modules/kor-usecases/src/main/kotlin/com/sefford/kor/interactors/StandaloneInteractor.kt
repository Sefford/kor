 * This is the Standalone interactor. Decorates one of the simple Interactor strategies.

 *
 * It is meant to supersede old [Executor][com.sefford.kor.providers.interfaces.Executor] in basic situations
 * by providing an Interactor that can function on its own. It will help on reducing constructor signatures on modules
 * that require a small number of use cases.
 *
 *
 * For more fine-grained thread management, Executor implementations are advised.
