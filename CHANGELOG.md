Changelog
=========
## Kor 4.3.0
_2018_06_17_
* Improved a little `UseCase.execute` readability
* Cleanup of `StandaloneUseCase` methods.
* `StandaloneUseCase` now provides a ser of methods:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`execute`: Sycnrhonous inmediate execution (as calling `UseCase.execute(params : Any)`)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`defer`: Asynchronous lazy execution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`async`: Asynchronous inmediate execution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`asynk`: Asynchronous lazy execution v√≠a Arrow's `DeferredK`


## Kor 4.2.1
_2018_06_8_

* `StandaloneUseCase` now has utility methods `deferK` to directly output a functional deferred call with Arrow.
* Improved `LruCache` to use Kotlin methods instead of relying in an iterator.
* Minor syntax improvements.

## Kor 4.2.1
_2018_05_11_

* Improved `UseCase.async(thread,postable,params)` with the correct method delegation

## Kor 4.2.0
_2018_05_11_

* Organized a little `StandaloneUseCase` API. Now `execute` are pure synchronous functions, and `async` requires (or not) of a Coroutine Context to be executed

## Kor 4.1.0
_2018_05_10_

* Added a `PerformanceModule` to the use case module to let users benchmark their use cases.
* Fixed a bug that was returning the wrong element when updating an element in `MemoryDataSource`

## Kor 4.0.0
_2018_04_14_

* AKA _"The FPenning"_
* Added FP principles to the core of kor common by Arrow.
* Added several utilities methods to the `Repository` interface for fetching, deleting and saving elements.
* All `interactors.*` elements are removed.
* Sliced and re-structured all the packages in order to be able to have smaller, more focused dependencies

## Kor 3.0.0
_2018-02-12_

* Ported to Kotlin
* Removed `FastInteractor` capabilities

## Kor 2.8.0
* **Breaking: 2.8.0 onwards:** `DiskJsonDataSource` now uses a `CacheFolder` interface to work instead of a simple File.
* Default implementation `CacheFolderImpl` for both DataSources and `FileExpirationPolicy`.

## Kor 2.7.0
_2017-11-29_

* **Breaking from 2.7.0 onwards:** `MemoryRepository` has been renamed to `MemoryDataSource` and `DiskJsonRepository` has been renamed to `DiskJsonDataSource`.
* Introduced `MemoryJsonDataSource`
* Improved `LruRepository` by honoring the state of the underlying repository in gets and contains.

## Kor 2.5.5
_2017-07-13_

* Added `Populator` plugin for `LruRepositories`, so `LruCaches` can be populated in certain circumstances like when using `DiskJsonRepositories`
* Added `FileTimeExpirationPolicy` for `ExpirationRepository` when backing `DiskJsonRepostory`
 
## Kor 2.5.5
_2017-06-21_

* Improved interactors to support performance logging facilities

## Kor 2.5.3
_2017-06-05_

* Now you do not need to extend `TwoTierRepository` and `MemoryRepository` to use it directly
* `BaseRepository` renamed to `TwoTierRepository`
* Minor improvements


* Added DiskJsonRepository to allow to-disk JSon peristence 
## Kor 2.5.1
_2017-06-05_

* Added DiskJsonRepository to allow to-disk JSon peristence 

## Kor 2.5.0
_2017-06-05_

* Refactored Repository structures to apply better OOP methodologies
* Added `LruRepository` to allow Repositories to hold a limited number of elements
* Added `ExpirationRepository` to allow Repositories to have an Expiration Policy
* Added `TimeExpirationPolicy` as a PoC expiration policy

## Kor 2.5.0
_2017-06-05_

* Refactored Repository structures to apply better OOP methodologies
* Added `LruRepository` to allow Repositories to hold a limited number of elements
* Added `ExpirationRepository` to allow Repositories to have an Expiration Policy
* Added `TimeExpirationPolicy` as a PoC expiration policy

## Kor Common 2.4.3
_2017-04-21_

* Minor fixes on certain circumstances with `BaseRepository`

## Kor Common 2.4.1
_2017-02-27_

* Corrected a small error with the signature of `logErrorResponse(Loggable)` method

## Kor Common 2.4.0
_2017-02-27_

* Added new `OptimisticNetworkInteractor`for providing fast UI updates then doing the hard work
* Correction of `BaseRepository` where `get(K)` was relying on `Repository.get(K)` instead of using `Repository.contains(K)`, prompting for less efficient lookups
* Added a new `logErrorResponse(Loggable)`method that allows better error reporting on Fabric 

## Kor Common 2.1
_2015-05-16_

* Additional classes renaming. Now `ResponseInterface` and `Error Interface` becomes `Response` and `Error`, respectively.
* `retrieveNetworkResponse` and `retrieveCacheResponse` unifies on `execute` method.
* Now all delegates extend from `Delegate` class. This class has the basic functionality of executing, composing an error message
and returning its name.
* Due to the previous change, now CacheDelegate can produce error responses. However the functionality of not returning a
response if the `Response.isSuccess()` remains.
* Added a `StandaloneInteractor` to reduce constructor signature on dependency injection by avoiding to provide a 
`Provider`, something alike an Interactor factory and a Builder.
 
## Kor Common 2.0
_2014-11-7_

 * Renamed classes to provide better understanding of what means each of the components on a clean architecture. Now `Requests` are renamed
 to `Delegates`, `Strategies` are renamed to `Interactors` and `Provider` `Executors`. From now on we will be using the new names instead of the old ones.
 * Removed dependencies towards `JobQueue`. Now `Interactors` are pure `Runnables` that can be executed via a `ThreadPoolExecutor` _(implementation
 not provided)_
 * Included a new `UpdateableInteractor` and `UpdateableDelegate` to perform looped request to the network _(e.g. Bluetooth-like Discovery Service)_

## Kor Retrofit 1.1
2014-11-7

 * Moved all the Strategies towards Kor-Commons.
 * Now this is a pure Java implementation.

## Kor Common 1.31
_2014-10-24_

 * `retrieveNetworkResponse` now throws an exception in order to properly catch erroneous responses
 through `composeErrorResponse(Exception`.

##Kor Retrofit 1.0.9
_2014-10-24_

 * Updated dependencency to kor-common 1.31

##Kor Android 1.0.1
_2014-10-24_

 * Updated dependencency to kor-common 1.31

##Kor Retrofit 1.0.8
_2014-08-21_

 * Minor bump that supports Kor-Common 1.2
 
## Kor Common 1.2
_2014-08-21_

 * New structure for `BaseRepository`, now delegates the calls to both internal `currentLevel` and
 `nextLevel` repositories, making the BaseRepository much more flexible.
 * Now `BaseRepository` has better implementations of `getAll()` and `getAll(ids)` methods. 
 * Now Kor-Common provide a `BaseFastRepository` which extends `BaseRepository` and implements 
 `FastRepository` interface.
 * Memory Map repository extracted to a individual Repository module that supposrts `FastRepository`
 interface.
 * Added `LruMemoryRepository` that supports recycling memory repositories via LRUCAche from
 android support library.
 
## Kor Retrofit 1.0.5
_2014-07-25_

 * Fixed bug that was preventing `composeErrorResponse(RetrofitError)` to be properly dispatched.
